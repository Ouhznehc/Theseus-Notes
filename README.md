# Theseus Notes

## Introduction to Theseus OS

[Theseus](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus) is a new OS written from scratch in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to experiment with novel OS structure, better state management, and how to leverage **intralingual design** principles to shift OS responsibilities like resource management into the compiler.

For more info, check out Theseus's [documentation](#Documentation) or [published academic papers](https://theseus-os.github.io/Theseus/book/misc/papers_presentations.html), which describe Theseus's design and implementation.

## Introduction to Theseus Notes

Theseus Notes, is a personal collection of insights, observations, and reflections as I navigate through the complexities of Theseus OS. It is intended to serve as both a learning resource for myself and a reference guide for others interested in understanding the internals of modern operating systems.

Throughout this book, I will explore various components of Theseus OS, dissecting its architecture, examining its codebase, and discussing the underlying design principles. My goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of Theseus OS while sharing my own learning experiences and discoveries along the way.

<!-- Whether you're a seasoned developer, a curious enthusiast, or simply intrigued by the world of operating systems, I hope that Theseus Notes will prove to be an informative and engaging resource for your journey into the heart of Theseus OS. -->

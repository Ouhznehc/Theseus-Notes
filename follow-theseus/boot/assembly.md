# Initial assembly code

Theseus starts from the `_start` function in `kernel/nano_core/src/asm/bios/boot.asm`, which is an assembly file. Next, we will progressively dissect the contents of this file, starting from the `_start` function:

```asm
_start:
	; The bootloader has loaded us into 32-bit protected mode. 
	; Interrupts are disabled. Paging is disabled.

	; To set up a stack, we set the esp register to point to the top of our
	; stack (as it grows downwards on x86 systems). This is necessarily done
	; in assembly as languages such as Rust cannot function without a stack.
	;
	; We subtract KERNEL_OFFSET from the stack address because we are not yet
	; mapped to the higher half
	mov esp, initial_bsp_stack_top - KERNEL_OFFSET

	; The multiboot2 specification requires the bootloader to load a pointer
	; to the multiboot2 information structure in the `ebx` register. Here we
	; mov it to `edi` so that rust can take it as a register. Because of this
	; we cannot clobber the edi register in any code before nano_core_start
	mov edi, ebx

	call check_multiboot
	call check_cpuid
	call check_long_mode

	call set_up_SSE
%ifdef ENABLE_AVX
	call set_up_AVX
%endif ; ENABLE_AVX

	call set_up_page_tables
	call unmap_guard_page
	call enable_paging

	; Load the 64-bit GDT
	lgdt [GDT.ptr_low - KERNEL_OFFSET]

	; Load the code selector with a far jmp
	; From now on instructions are 64 bits and this file is invalid
	jmp GDT.code:long_mode_start; -> !
```

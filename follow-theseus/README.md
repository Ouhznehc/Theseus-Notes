# Following Theseus: Exploring Code as it Runs

Welcome to the "Following Theseus" section of Theseus Notes! Here, we embark on a journey through the codebase of Theseus OS as it executes, exploring various components, understanding their significance, functionality, and their interconnections with other parts of the system.

In this section, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how Theseus OS operates under the hood. By following Theseus as it runs, we dissect critical components of the system, analyze their behaviors, and elucidate their roles in the broader context of operating system design.
